# Business-Insight-360
AtliQ Hardwares, a rapidly growing tech company, finds itself struggling to match data skilled competitors. Most of their valuable insights are locked away in Excel. My mission is to transform their data strategy with Power BI, empowering AtliQ to make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge.

This project aims to create a single report that meets the needs of stakeholders from sales, marketing, finance, and the executive team.

Focusing on:

1.Building a strong foundation with robust data modeling.

2.Designing reports with users in mind, ensuring they're easy to understand and navigate.

3.Providing detailed insights that can be explored further.

During this project, I've gained experience in:

1.Power Query, both basic & advanced techniques.

2.Working with basic & complex DAX formulas.

3.Handling data from over 10 tables.

4.Selecting appropriate visuals and formatting effectively.

5.Applying principles of dashboard design.

6.Using bookmarks to enhance user experience.

7.Deploying reports in the Power BI service.

8.Acting on feedback from stakeholders to improve the report.

9.Incorporating metrics from sales, marketing, finance, and supply chain areas.

This experience has enriched my skills and understanding of data analysis and reporting in Power BI.
